# Meditation I: Skeptical doubts
### "On what can be called into doubt" 

In philosophy, skeptical means: "relating to the theory that certain knowledge is impossible". 

## Summary

### The foundation of knowledge
- Descartes reflects on the number of falsehoods he has believed during his life and on the subsequent faultiness of the body of knowledge he has built up from these falsehoods. He has resolved to sweep away all he thinks he knows and to start again from the foundations, **building up his knowledge once more on more certain grounds.** 
- **The foundation of his knowledge is weak, because of all the falsehoods he has believed early on in his life**, so he wishes to have them erased from himself, and start afresh, so that the foundation can be strong. Or as Master Yoda put it, **unlearn what he has learnt** :P He wants to demolish his former opinions. 

- Rather than doubt every one of his opinions individually, he reasons that he might cast them all into doubt if **he can doubt the foundations and basic principles** upon which his opinions are founded. This is because most of his opinions might be founded on the same foundation. So if he doubts the foundation, he will automatically doubt all that's built upon It. 

### Senses
- Everything that the Meditator has accepted as most true he has come to learn from or through his senses. He acknowledges that sometimes the **senses can deceive**, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. 

- He acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn't worry himself about that. But yes, some of the falsehoods he has believed may have been due to his senses, as they can deceive! 

### Dream argument
- However, he realizes that he is often convinced when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Because sometimes, **dreams appear to be true!** 

- Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even **dream images are drawn from waking experience**, much like paintings in that respect.

### Painter's Analogy
- Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the **composite parts are drawn from real things**--women and fish, in the case of a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience.
- Thus, the Meditator concludes, though **he can doubt composite things**, he **cannot doubt the simple and universal parts** from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.

### Doubting simple things? - God and Satan
- On further reflection, the Meditator realizes that **even simple things can be doubted**. Omnipotent (unlimited power) **God could make even our conception of mathematics false.** 
- One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God **would not deceive him with regard to anything**, and yet this is clearly not true. **If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived**, since our imperfect senses would not have been created by a perfect being.

### The evil demon
- He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. **By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.**

## Analysis

This meditation sets the groundwork for the meditations that follow, where doubt is employed as a powerful tool against Aristotelian philosophy. This meditation is also **the foundation of modern skepticism.** 

- Like Galileo, he sought to overturn two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. **The Aristotelian thought** of Descartes' day placed a great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all **knowledge comes from the senses.**

- There is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous "Dream Argument" to suggest the **universal possibility of dreaming**--that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking--or the possibility of a universal dream--**that my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world.**
- If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later "Evil Demon Argument." **The latter suggests that all we know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit.** The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable.
- The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The "Painter's Analogy," which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is **an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.**
- Here **he wants to persuade his Aristotelian readers to purge themselves of their prejudices**. He also hopes to lead the mind away from the senses that are so heavily relied upon by the Aristotelians. In the meditations that follow, he will argue that our most certain knowledge comes from the mind unaided by the senses.
- Lastly, this process of radical doubt will hopefully rule out any doubts from the positive claims Descartes will build up in the next five meditations. First Meditation can be seen as presenting skeptical doubts as a subject of study in their own right. Descartes was the first to raise **the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us.** The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. **And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything?**
- Skepticism cuts straight to the heart of the Western philosophical enterprise and its **attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world.** It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality. No one actually lives skepticism i.e. no one actually doubts whether other people really exist. But it is very difficult to justify a dismissal of skepticism. 
- We should note that **Descartes' doubt is a methodological and rational doubt.** That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects the possibility that he might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.
