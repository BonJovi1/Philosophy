# Meditation I: Skeptical doubts
### "What can be called into doubt" 

In philosophy, skeptical means: "relating to the theory that certain knowledge is impossible". This meditation sets the groundwork for the meditations that follow, where doubt is employed as a powerful tool against Aristotelian philosophy. This meditation is also the foundation of modern skepticism. 

- The Aristotelian thought suggested that all knowledge comes from the senses.
- No one actually lives skepticism i.e. no one actually doubts whether other people really exist. But it is very difficult to justify a dismissal of skepticism.
