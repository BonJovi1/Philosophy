# Meditation III
## Existence of God and the Cartesian Circle

### Summary 

When considering God as "a substance that is infinite, eternal, immutable, independent, supremely intelligent, supremely powerful, and which created both myself and everything else," the Meditator realizes that **the idea of God must have far more objective reality than he has formal reality**: God is an infinite substance whereas he is only a finite substance. 
**Since the idea of God cannot have originated in himself, he concludes that God must be the cause of this idea and must therefore necessarily exist.**

The Meditator counters the argument that he might conceive of an infinite being through negation, that is, through conceiving of it in contrast to his own finite being. Doubts and desires come from an understanding that we lack something, and we would not be aware of that lack unless we were aware of a more perfect being that has those things which we lack.

While he can doubt the existence of other things, he cannot doubt the existence of God, since **he has such a clear and distinct perception of God's existence**. The idea has infinite objective reality, and is therefore more likely to be true than any other idea.

The Meditator then entertains **the possibility that he may be supremely perfect,** that all his deficiencies are potentialities within him, and that he is slowly improving toward perfection. If perfection is a potentiality within him, then it is plausible that **the idea of God could be conceived in him without any outside cause.** The Meditator rejects this possibility for three reasons: first, **God is all actual and not at all potential**; second, if he is constantly improving, he will never attain that perfection where there is no room for improvement; and third, **potential being is not being at all: the idea of God must be caused by something with infinite actual being.**

If the Meditator could exist without God, he would have come to be out of herself, or from his parents, or from some other being less perfect than God. If he derived his existence from himself, there is no reason that he should have doubts and desires. 
If his parents or some other imperfect being created him, this creator must have endowed him with the idea of God. If this creator is a finite being, we must still ask with respect to it **how it came to possess the idea of an infinite God**. We can trace this chain back through countless creators, but we must ultimately conclude that **the idea of God can originate only in God, and not in some finite being.**

Having concluded that God must necessarily exist, the Meditator asks how he received the idea of God. The idea cannot be adventitious, coming from without, nor can it be invented by the Meditator. Thus, **the idea must be innate, and the Meditator must have been created by God with this idea already in him**. He clearly and distinctly perceives that God is no deceiver, since all deception relies on some defect or other, and a perfect God has no defects.

### Analysis

When Descartes started this meditation, he was only certain of one thing: that he exists. He  wa certain of the fact that he is a thinking thing. The fact that he is doubting and thinking and being deceived, all implies that he must exist. But why does it imply that if one thinks, he/she exists? Because his clear and distinct perception shows that one must think to exist. But what if this evil genius is deceiving us through this clear perception? Hence, Descartes needs the concept of God as a guarantor of clear and distinct perception. 

He concludes that he comes to know these facts through clear and distinct perception, and reasons that it should follow that all his other clear and distinct perceptions are true. 

In order to confirm the truth of clear and distinct perceptions, however, he must prove the existence of a benevolent God. If God were a deceiver, he could be deceived even with respect to his clear and distinct perceptions i.e. these perceptions could be wrong. However, the proof of the existence of God relies on the Meditator's having a clear and distinct perception of the idea of God.

The proof seems to fall into what is now called the "**Cartesian Circle**". The Meditator seems committed to claiming both (a) that we can only be sure of our clear and distinct perceptions if God exists and (b) we can know that God exists because we clearly and distinctly perceive the idea of God. If both (a) and (b) are true, Descartes is guilty of circular reasoning.
