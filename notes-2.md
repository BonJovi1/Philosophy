# Meditation II
## cogito ergo sum, sum res cogitans

### Summary
The Second Meditation is subtitled "The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body" and takes place the day after the First Meditation. The Meditator is firm in his resolve to continue his search for certainty and to discard as false anything that is open to the slightest doubt.

- He recalls Archimedes' famous saying that he could shift the entire earth given one immovable point: similarly, he hopes to achieve great things if he can be certain of just one thing. 

- Recalling the previous meditation, he supposes that what he sees does not exist, that his memory is faulty, that he has no senses and no body, that extension, movement and place are mistaken notions. Perhaps, he remarks, the only certain thing remaining is that there is no certainty.
- Then, he wonders, is not he, the source of these meditations, not something? He has conceded that he has no senses and no body, but does that mean he cannot exist either? He has also noted that the physical world does not exist, which might also seem to imply his nonexistence. And yet to have these doubts, he must exist.
- For an evil demon to mislead him in all these insidious ways, he must exist in order to be misled.
- There must be an "I" that can doubt, be deceived, and so on. He formulates the famous _cogito_ argument, saying: "So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, _I am, I exist,_ is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind."
- The Meditator's next question, then, is what this "I" that exists is. He initially thought that he had a soul, by means of which he was nourished, moved, could sense and think; and also that he had a body. All these attributes have been cast into doubt, except one: he cannot doubt that he thinks.
- He may exist without any other of the above attributes, but he cannot exist if he does not think. Further, he only exists as long as he is thinking. Therefore, thought above all else is inseparable from being. The Meditator concludes that, in the strict sense, he is only a thing that thinks.

### Analysis

"I think, therefore I am". This is possibly the most famous single line in all of philosophy, and is generally considered the starting point for modern Western philosophy. In it, the Meditator finds his first grip on certainty after the radical skepticism he posited in the First Meditation.

- It should be noted that the _cogito_ only works for thought. I cannot say, "I walk, therefore I am," since I can doubt I am walking. The reason I cannot doubt that I am thinking is that doubt itself is a form of thought.

- After the _cogito,_ the Meditator advances the claim that he is a thing that thinks, an argument called the _sum res cogitans,_ after its Latin formulation. There are three controversies regarding the claim "I am...in the strict sense only a thing that thinks," which we will examine in turn: whether the claim is metaphysical or epistemological, what is meant by "thing," and what is meant by "thinking."

- But if everything is to be doubted, how can the Meditator know the _cogito_? A reading interprets the _cogito_ as a performative utterance, where the utterance itself is what confirms its truth. That is, I could not say "I exist" if I did not exist or if I did not think, and so the act of saying it is what makes it true.

- We should note, however, the distinction between the "I think, therefore I am" and the formulation we get in the _Meditations_: "So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, _I am, I exist,_ is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind." Neither "therefore" nor "I think" appear in the _Meditations._ The absence of "therefore" is important, since it dissuades us from reading the _cogito_ as a syllogism, that is, as a three-step argument as follows:
(1) Whatever thinks exists
(2) I think
therefore,
(3) I exist

The trouble with a syllogistic reading, which Descartes explicitly denies elsewhere in his writings, is that no reason is given why (1) should be immune from the doubt that the Meditator has posited.
