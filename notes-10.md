## Critique of innate ideas - Book 1

Book I, "Of Innate Notions," is an attack on the theory that human beings are born knowing certain things.

he criticizes the possibility of innate theoretical principles. Locke's argument against innate theoretical principles can be captured in three sentences: If, in fact, there are any innate principles, then everyone would assent to them. There are no principles that everyone assents to. Therefore, there are no innate principles.
the nativist (or believer in the existence of innate principles) asserts his claim in its strongest form (i.e. there are certain theoretical principles to which everyone would assent), to which Locke objects.
First, he draws our attention to developing children (a tactic to which he will appeal repeatedly throughout the text). He claims that they clearly come into the world devoid of ideas, since they only ever seem to have the ideas of those things they have experienced. 
Last, he turns to the idea of God, the idea he feels is the likeliest candidate for innateness. This idea, however, is clearly not innate, since many cultures recognize no god.
There are certain principles that are universally agreed upon and the only way to explain this is to suppose that these principles are innate. Locke's primary reply is that there are no such principles.

The nativist then refines his position: Our knowledge of these principles does not start out as explicit and conscious knowledge, rather we have tacit knowledge of the principles in question, and it takes some work to make this tacit knowledge explicit. Locke's response is to call this position incoherent. It is impossible for something to be in the mind without our being aware of it; to be in the mind, to be mental, is to be conscious. 
There is, first of all, the problem of memory; we are not conscious of memories but they are in the mind. There is also the issue of non-conscious principles, propositions, or bits of knowledge. Even when I am not thinking that two plus two equals four, I am tempted to say that I still know it. (In reply to these objections Locke would most likely argue that in order to get into the mind we had at one time to be conscious of these memories and truths.) we know something if and only if we know what to do with it once it comes into awareness.

This is exactly the point that the nativist next makes. It is not really that we have tacit knowledge, he says, but that we have an innate capacity or disposition, an inborn ability to entertain certain ideas and arrive at certain principles. Locke dismisses this position, claiming that the doctrine is empty because it ends up saying that everything we know is innate (since we obviously have the capacity to know everything we come to know). He also points out that it does not really qualify as a theory of innate principles, since it admits that experience is required to trigger any and all knowledge.

the nativist is simply Locke playing devil's advocate with himself xD

Though experience is necessary to trigger knowledge on these models of the mind, experience is not sufficient for knowledge. Innate categories of thought, in the form of certain innate principles, are needed if human beings are to arrive at any knowledge through experience.

## Simple Ideas - Book 2

Now that Locke feels he has demonstrated where knowledge does not come from (i.e. innate principles or ideas), he sets out to show where it does, in fact, come from. 
Knowledge is built up from ideas. Ideas come in two basic types: simple and complex. Complex ideas are built from simple ideas. All knowledge, therefore, traces back to simple ideas, and simple ideas come exclusively through experience.

There are only two ways that a simple idea can find its way into a human mind: through sensation, or by reflection. In sensation the mind turns outward to the world and receives ideas through the faculties of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. In reflection the mind turns toward its own operations, receiving such as ideas as "thinking," "willing," "believing," "doubting." ideas we receive from a single sense, such as from sight or touch. The idea of blue and of the sound of a trumpet would be examples of ideas from this category. The idea of solidity, which receives its own chapter (iv), would be another. Chapter v looks at those ideas that get into the mind through more than one sense. Shape and size, for instance, are ideas that arise both from our sense of sight and from our sense of touch.

Ideas which come into the mind through reflection are the topic of chapter vi, and chapter vii focuses on those ideas which are the product of both sensation and reflection. As examples of this last type of idea, Locke uses the ideas of unity, existence, pleasure, pain, and substance.

we can break all of our experiences down into their fundamental parts. If we see a cat, for instance, we can break that sensation down into blackness, softness, shininess, a certain size, a certain shape, etc. Fundamental bits, those that are "uncompounded, without parts," and cannot be broken down any further, are the simple ideas. 
One has to wonder whether there really can be an end to this analysis of experience down into component parts, whether there are any fundamental parts that cannot be broken down any further.

As an even more unsettling example, take the taste of wine. To people with unsophisticated palates, this is an uncompounded idea, but other people sense many components in a single sip of good wine. To them, this idea is complex. Locke certainly would not want simplicity to be relative, though. He wants the same experiences to give rise to the same simple ideas in everyone. This criterion for simplicity, then, seems to fail.

Locke claims that simple ideas are those that cannot conceivably get into the mind in any way other than by experience. To illustrate, he tells the story of a man who has never eaten a pineapple but wants to know what one tastes like. No matter how much this man reads about the taste of a pineapple, or has a friend describe the sensation in all of its detail, this man will never know what a pineapple tastes like until he eats one.
